# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Tip calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


### The challenge

In this challenge, I went back to the good old Vanilla JavaScript and did some extra practice as I have been working with React in the past two months. As someone who has just started coding not long time ago, I want to make sure that my JavaScript fundamentals are ok and not rusty. It's not perfect as I have a lot of things happening in life at the moment but when I can, I'll make sure to give this project some extra love.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
